--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To OpenAz Maillist:

Version 101 of OpenAz has been uploaded, which should provide a 
straight-forward download, build, and run as will be described below. 
The instructions below are basically consistent w the previous email for 
version 99:
    http://lists.openliberty.org/pipermail/openaz/2010-July/000077.html

however, the instructions below are focused on running the 
OpenAzTutorial program, which is intended to be the starting point for 
expanding a broader tutorial.

The main changes in this version are:

   1. The logging has been cleaned up so that log.info now only is used
      for informatory and not trace info.
   2. The logging remains based on Apache Commons Logging (JCL):
        http://commons.apache.org/logging/guide.html
   3. A brief explanation of logging configuration options is included
      in the release in:
        <TOPOFPROJECT>\openaz\test\config\logging\OpenAzLoggingGuide.txt
      which explains how to use the SimpleLog, along w some guidance on
      getting log info out of sunxacml.
   4. The first tutorial module:
        <TOPOFPROJECT>\openaz\test\src\tutorial\OpenAzTutorial.java
      has been cleaned up a bit, and basically follows the
      TestStyles.testStyleString() method. It does 2 requests, one for a
      "good user" that succeeds, and one for a "bad user" that fails.
      The output of executing this is shown in the attached file as a
      byproduct of providing the command prompt listing that follows the
      instructions below to download, build and run.
   5. One can also run the other test programs, like TestStyles,
      QueryTest, and BulkDecideTest using the same command line as in
      the instructions below, except change the class from
      tutorial.OpenAzTutorial to test.TestStyles, etc. Also the file
      names with policy info changes, see prev email for version 99,
      ref'd above for that specific command line.



First the "download, build, and run" instructions, then a brief 
explanation of what the results should be.

The instructions below are also in the attached txt file, which also has 
the results of executing the instructions from a command prompt.

All the javadoc associated with the project should be included with the 
download and viewable from:
    <TOPOFPROJECT>\openaz\test\doc\index.html

************************************************

    download openaz v101 from:
	http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/
    right click on lower left "Download GNU tarball" and save
	in the directory that will be referred to as <TOPOFPROJECT>

	for example, below, the tarball was put in:
	  C:\Notes\Downloads\OpenAz\V101

	so, in my case:
	  <TOPOFPROJECT> = C:\Notes\Downloads\OpenAz\V101

     unzip the tarball in place (need to do it twice:t
	1. openaz.tar.gz extracts to openaz.tar
	2. openaz.tar extracts to openaz directory, which has
		absolute path:
		 <TOPOFPROJECT>\openaz
		or:
		 C:\Notes\Downloads\OpenAz\V101\openaz

      to build the project, the following should work from the
	command prompt:

cd <TOPOFPROJECT>
cd openaz\test\build
ant clean
ant

	in my case, I did:

	cd \Notes\Downloads\OpenAz\V101
	cd openaz\test\build
	ant clean
	ant


    to run the tutorial program:

cd <TOPOFPROJECT>\openaz\test\bin
set baseline=<TOPOFPROJECT>\openaz
java -cp .;%baseline%\pep\bin;%baseline%\pdp\bin;%baseline%\azapi\bin;%baseline%\lib\jakarta-commons\commons-logging.jar;%baseline%\pdp\lib\sunxacml.jar tutorial.OpenAzTutorial  %baseline%\test\policy\OpenAz-Pseudo-Test-Policy.txt

	in my case, I did:

	cd \Notes\Downloads\OpenAz\V101\openaz\test\bin
	set baseline=C:\Notes\Downloads\OpenAz\V101\openaz
	java -cp .;%baseline%\pep\bin;%baseline%\pdp\bin;%baseline%\azapi\bin;%baseline%\lib\jakarta-commons\commons-logging.jar;%baseline%\pdp\lib\sunxacml.jar tutorial.OpenAzTutorial  %baseline%\test\policy\OpenAz-Pseudo-Test-Policy.txt


************************************************

If everything went as intended, the last thing should be the output from 
OpenAzTutorial, which is included in the attachment.

Basically, what's going on is the following:

    The input file,
    %baseline%\test\policy\OpenAz-Pseudo-Test-Policy.txt, is written
    using the XACML Shorthand described in earlier emails. The exact
    file contains the following:

        PolicySet
        Target
          TA (act-id, "Tutorial-Read")
        Policy
          Target
          Rules(Policy)
           Rule (ef:Permit)
            Target
              TS (sub-id, "Joe Smith")
              TR (res-id, "C:\\\\jsmith\\\\.*" mtId:rgx-mt)
           Rule (ef:Deny)
            Target
            

    This PolicySet applies to any request that has an action of
    "Tutorial-Read". The main reason for including this is to avoid
    conflict with other PolicySets, as sunxacml only allows one
    top-level PolicySet. This is not a "problem", but simply an artifact
    of XACML, which is effectively a technique for partitioning
    "domains" of applicability as part of managing policies.
    The main Policy has one rule that grants a "Permit" to Joe Smith, if
    he is accessing, any files under the top level directory C:\jsmith.
    The final rule explicitly denies anyone else access to anything and
    Joe Smith to anything other than his designated subdirectories of
    C:\jsmith.
    The OpenAzTutorial.runStringTest method tries 2 accesses, one by Joe
    Smith that works, and one by Joe Bad User that is Denied.

    In the process, the program generates the XML Xacml file, which may
    be examined in:
        <TOPOFPROJECT>\openaz\test\policy\OpenAz-Pseudo-Test-Policy.txt.xml

    The ratio of bytes of these 2 policy files is: 2273 bytes for the
    xacml xml file, and 235 bytes for the xacml shorthand file, which is
    nearly a ratio of 10:1. I expect in general that ratios between 5:1
    and 10:1 will by typical when using the xacml shorthand. The main
    benefit in the current project is that it makes the policies 5 or 10
    times easier to manage for testing purposes, and has already repaid
    itself in time savings for the time it took to develop it.

Next steps will focus on further enhancing the tutorial with more test 
cases, which initially will be
pulled from TestStyles, QueryTest, and BulkDecideTest.

Will plan to have scheduled call Thu Aug 5, 1PM ET.

    Thanks,
    Rich
